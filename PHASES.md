# TruthLens Development Phases

## Phase 1: Robust Data Collection (Current)

- [x] Basic URL fetching
- [x] Simple HTML extraction
- [x] Add logging and error monitoring
- [ ] Implement concurrent scraping (threading/asyncio)
- [ ] Add retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- [ ] Implement rate limiting and user-agent rotation
- [ ] Unit tests for data collection module

Success Criteria:

- Can reliably scrape 1000+ URLs without failures
- Respects rate limits and robot rules
- Has comprehensive error handling

## Phase 2: Advanced Preprocessing

- [x] Text cleaning and normalization
- [x] Language detection
- [x] Content validation
- [ ] Content deduplication
- [ ] Boilerplate and advertising removal
- [ ] Integration tests with data collection
- [ ] Text preprocessing pipeline tests

Success Criteria:

- Clean, normalized text output
- Removed duplicates and irrelevant content
- Validated content quality

## Phase 3: Dataset Creation

- [x] Define annotation schema
- [x] Create annotation guidelines
- [x] Create data quality checks
- [ ] Build/adopt annotation tool
- [ ] Collect initial ground truth dataset
- [ ] Implement data versioning
- [ ] Document dataset characteristics

Success Criteria:

- Labeled dataset of 1000+ examples
- Balanced classes
- Documented bias considerations

## Phase 4: Model Development

- [ ] Feature engineering pipeline
- [ ] Baseline model implementation
- [ ] Model training workflow
- [ ] Evaluation metrics
- [ ] Cross-validation setup
- [ ] Model interpretability tools
- [ ] Model performance analysis

Success Criteria:

- Working ML pipeline
- Model beats random baseline
- Interpretable predictions

## Phase 5: Production Infrastructure

- [ ] API development
- [ ] Database integration
- [ ] Containerization
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Security review

Success Criteria:

- Production-ready API
- Automated deployment
- Monitoring in place

## Phase 6: Evaluation and Iteration

- [ ] Large-scale testing
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] User feedback integration
- [ ] Model updates pipeline
- [ ] System scalability testing
- [ ] Ethics and bias assessment

Success Criteria:

- System handles production load
- Regular update cycle established
- Documented ethical considerations

## Dependencies

- Phase 1 → Phase 2: Need robust data collection before advanced preprocessing
- Phase 2 → Phase 3: Need clean data before annotation
- Phase 3 → Phase 4: Need labeled dataset before model development
- Phase 4 → Phase 5: Need working model before production deployment
- Phase 5 → Phase 6: Need production system before large-scale testing

## Current Status

Currently transitioning from Phase 1 to Phase 2. Completed:

- Basic data collection with error handling
- Text cleaning and validation
- Annotation schema and guidelines
- Data quality checks
- Organized test suite structure

Next immediate steps:

1. Complete concurrent scraping implementation
2. Add retry mechanism
3. Implement deduplication
4. Expand test coverage in organized test suite
5. Add comprehensive tests
