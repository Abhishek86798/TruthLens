## Layman's Summary

### What We've Built

Think of TruthLens as a "fact-checking assistant" that:

1. Collects information from websites (like a smart copy-paste)
2. Cleans up the text (like spell-check, but more advanced)
3. Checks if claims are reliable (like a basic lie detector)
4. Keeps track of all data (like a organized filing system)

### What's Left

We need to:

1. Make the "lie detector" smarter
2. Make everything run faster
3. Add better testing
4. Make it easy for others to use
5. Package it all up neatly

### Current Capabilities

- Can collect web content automatically
- Can clean and organize text
- Can detect basic patterns in claims
- Can store and track data changes
- Has a simple working model

### Next Steps

- Make the model more accurate
- Make it easier to use
- Add more features
- Make it ready for real-world use
- Create proper documentation

## Project Health Metrics

- Code Quality: Good
- Documentation: Basic
- Test Coverage: Moderate
- Performance: Good
- Scalability: Moderate

## Timeline

- Remaining work: ~12-15 days
- Expected completion: 2-3 weeks with testing
